# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started:

## What is a changeset?

A changeset is a file that contains a description of the changes you've made to your codebase. It's used to
generate a changelog and determine the next version number for your package.

## How do I add a changeset?

To add a changeset, run:

```bash
bunx changeset
```

This will prompt you to select the type of change (major, minor, or patch) and provide a description of the changes.

## What happens when I merge a PR with changesets?

When a PR with changesets is merged to the main branch, the Changesets GitHub Action will:
1. Create a new PR that bumps the version number
2. Update the changelog
3. When that PR is merged, it will trigger a release workflow that publishes to npm

## How do I publish manually?

If you need to publish manually, you can run:

```bash
bunx changeset version
bunx changeset publish
```
